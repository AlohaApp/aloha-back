# Aloha! ðŸ‘‹
### Wellcome to your new office.

Make easier your **onboarding** processes and lend a hand to new people **to locate and meet colleagues**, using a **simple gamification** strategy:

- **creating a map** of your office and **locating team members** on it,
- **exploring the map** and using a **customizable search engine** about people knowledge and projects,
-  **play games** with your colleague's information to help to remember easier **who's who** in the team.

## How does it work?

As an **admin**, *Aloha!* allows you to:

- **Create** as many **offices** or buildings as you need.
- Associate **floors** to the offices, uploading a **PNG, JPG or SVG file** for each one.
- **Register every worker and locate** them on the floors.
- **Manage** everybody's **data and games**.

As users, **office workers** are able to:

- **Explore maps** and see everybody's profile.
- Complete and edit their own **profile information**.
- **Search people** using different criteria.
- **Visualize results** on the map or a list.
- **Play games** related with colleagues.

## Why Open Source?

Although *Aloha!* emerged from a **specific need** in [Corunet](https://coru.net/), we believe that it has many **possibilities** as an open source project because...

- We haven't found **any open source software** with these features. Even paying. If you find one, please, **share it with us!**
- It's **applicable to different** labor or organizational **contexts**, where **teams** participate.
- There are **many options to extend** functionalities.

## Launch it!
