# Aloha!
### Wellcome to your new office.

Make easier your **onboarding processes** and help new people in the office to **locate and meet new colleagues**, using a **search engine** with customizable options and a simple **gamification strategy**.

## How does it work?

As an **admin**, *Aloha!* allows you to:

- **Create** as many **offices** or buildings as you need.
- Associate **floors** to the offices, uploading a **PNG, JPG or SVG file** for each one.
- **Register every worker and locate** them on the floors.
- **Manage** everybody's **data and games**.

As users, **office workers** are able to:

- **Explore maps** and see everybody's profile.
- Complete and edit their own **profile information**.
- **Search people** using different criteria.
- **Visualize results** on the map or a list.
- **Play games** related with colleagues.
